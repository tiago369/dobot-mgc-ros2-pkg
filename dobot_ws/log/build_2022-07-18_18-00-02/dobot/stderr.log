CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:42 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmessage_package.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "message_package", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "message_package"
  with any of the following names:

    message_packageConfig.cmake
    message_package-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "message_package" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "message_package_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "message_package" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
